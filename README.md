### Rundown
File order to run project

- Start with “eda.ipynb” file to get an understanding of the data
- Next open “clean.ipynb” file to clean data for machine learning. At this step files are split in to three folders called clean_train, clean_val, and clean_test. Inside each folder is a csv, the name is “port-xxxx”. Numbers and letters after the port may change based on the environment the code is being implemented in.  The right file path is already in the notebooks but the name of the csv file maybe different. 
- Next open “Machine_learning.ipynb” file to create and train the model
- Next open the “Validation.ipynb” file to test model on new data
- Finally open the “Test.ipynb” file to see the results of the single review
